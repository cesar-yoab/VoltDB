# VoltDB

VoltDB is an in-memory vector database that combines the ideas of Redis and Pinecone. It is designed to provide fast and efficient vector operations while maintaining low latency and high throughput. VoltDB is built using the Rust programming language and leverages the Tokio framework for asynchronous I/O.

## Features

- Hybrid storage: In-memory storage combined with optional disk-based persistence for increased data durability
- Vector similarity search: Native support for similarity search operations on multi-dimensional vectors
- Custom data structures: Extensible and customizable data structures for specific use cases
- Horizontal scalability: Support for distributed deployment to handle larger datasets and increased read/write loads
- Advanced caching strategies: Implementation of advanced caching strategies like LRU and LFU for optimal memory management
- High-performance networking: Utilizing Rust's async/await and Tokio's advanced networking capabilities for low-latency communication
- Machine learning support: Integration with popular machine learning libraries for seamless vector-based ML operations
- Advanced monitoring: Comprehensive metrics and monitoring support for effective performance analysis and debugging

## Installation

To build and install VoltDB, you will need Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can follow the [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to set up the Rust toolchain.

Clone the repository and build the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VoltDB.git
cd VoltDB
cargo build --release
```
This will create an executable in **`./target/release/voltdb.ko`**

## Usage
To start the VoltDB server, run the following command:

```sh
./target/release/voltdb
```

By default, the server will listen on 127.0.0.1:6379. You can configure the server settings by editing the config/settings.rs file.

For client-side usage and examples, please refer to the examples/ directory.

## Documentation
You can generate the project documentation with the following command:

```sh
cargo doc --open
```
This will build the documentation and open it in your web browser.

## Testing
To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```sh
cargo test
```
This will run both unit and integration tests.

## Benchmarks
Performance benchmarks can be found in the benchmarks/ directory. To run them, use the following command:

```sh
cargo bench
```
